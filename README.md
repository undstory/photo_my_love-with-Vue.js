# Photo_my_love -> multi-page website with-Vue.js

I designed and created this project myself with my favourite framework --> Vue.js (one and only). My knowledge of Vue.js is not very impressive, I know very well that I still have a lot to learn, but Vue absorbed me completely... This project is another attempt to use the knowledge gained so far in practice.

## Created with:

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Flexbox
* JavaScript (with ES6)
* Vue.js <3
* RWD of course
